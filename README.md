# Intelligent Assembly of Aerospace Structural Modules

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project, "Intelligent Assembly of Aerospace Structural Modules." This project was conducted by a dedicated team of students from Zhongshan University, under the guidance of Professor Wang Xing. Our goal was to explore innovative technologies for the intelligent assembly of aerospace structural modules, focusing on the use of a single-arm robotic arm for precise positioning and rapid connection of pre-designed modular components.

## Project Overview
- **Project Duration**: January 2023 - December 2023
- **Team Members**: Chen Shiyu, He Hongxin, Duan Yue, Rao Jiansheng, Zeng Xinyue(陈诗雨, 何泓辛, 段跃, 饶鉴晟, 曾欣玥)
- **Institution**: School of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Sun Yat-sen University(SYSU)
- **Guide**: Prof. Wang Xing

### Objectives
- To develop a modular design for aerospace structures, allowing flexible combination and reconstruction according to different needs and environments.
- To utilize a multi-degree-of-freedom mechanical arm for positioning and assembly of modules.
- To implement a software platform for simulating the design, manufacturing, transport, launch, and in-orbit assembly of aerospace structural modules.

### Innovations and Features
- **Modular Design**: Standardized interfaces and functions for each module, enhancing adaptability and practicality.
- **Intelligent Assembly**: Utilization of robotic arms in orbit for module positioning and connection.
- **Simulation and Testing**: Comprehensive software and hardware simulations to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our technological solutions.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains all the code and documentation related to our project. Here’s what you’ll find:

- **Module Design Files**: CAD designs and specifications for the aerospace modules.
- **Robotic Arm Control Scripts**: Code used for operating and controlling the robotic arm during the assembly process.
- **Simulation Software**: Programs developed for simulating the assembly process.
- **Documentation**: Detailed project reports, research papers, and technical documentation.

## Installation and Usage
Instructions on how to set up and use the software and simulations are provided in the respective directories. Please refer to the README files in each folder for detailed steps.

## Challenges and Resolutions
During our project, we encountered and overcame several challenges:

1. **Hardware-Software Incompatibility**: Initial issues with the robotic arm hardware not aligning with the provided software. Resolved through collaborative efforts with the manufacturer.
2. **Motor Overload**: Overcame a critical problem where the robotic arm's motor was overloaded and damaged, necessitating repairs.
3. **Code Compatibility**: Addressed issues where our custom-developed code was not running on the robotic arm’s system environment, requiring environment configuration.

## Contributions and Collaborations
We encourage contributions and collaborations from the community. If you're interested in improving the code, suggest features, or report bugs, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
